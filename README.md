# Practicing frontend website development

I want to practice the skills I'm learning in the software engineering part of
the Data Science Nanodegree so I can actually master them somewhat. My goal for
this website is for it to allow one to cycle through pictures saved via the
[Windows 10 background image scraper][1].

Stages:
1. HTML (Bootstrap)
    1. Basic layout
    2. Images
2. CSS
    1. Margins/padding
    2. Better formatting
3. jquery
    1. Change pictures
    2. Shuffle functionality
    3. Voting?
